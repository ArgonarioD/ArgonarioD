## Hi there 👋

I'm ArgonarioD, working as a software engineer at a internet company with a primary focus on Java Web (though most of my public GitHub repositories showcase other languages/technologies).

- 👨🏻‍💻By day: Java Web
- 🏠By night: IM Chatbot, Game, Game Modding, and collecting ideas for big things!

Always excited to explore new ideas and solutions in the ever-evolving world of Computer Science and Technology!
