## Hi there 👋

I'm ArgonarioD, working as a software engineer at an internet company with a primary focus on building scalable Java Web apps and frameworks for innovative e-commerce platforms.

_(Though most of my public GitHub repositories showcase other languages/technologies)_

- 👨🏻‍💻By day: Java Web
- 🏠By night: IM Chatbot, Game, Game Modding, and collecting ideas for big things!

Always excited to explore new ideas and solutions in the ever-evolving world of Computer Science and Technology!
